# grepsedawk/.dotfiles

This is a configuration/dotfile repository for me to fast track rebuilding my development environment.

## Usage

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grepsedawk/.dotfiles/main/install | bash
```

## "Try it before you buy it"

This is available via docker for shell/tmux/vim configs and also a web browser i3 demo

Just run `docker run -it -p 6080:6080 grepsedawk/dotfiles` then navigate to [localhost:6080](localhost:6080)
